## Hi there üëã

### About Me

I'm a software developer proficient in Rust & Python and always aim to build
capable and reliable code. I've also previously worked with Deep Learning in [computer
vision](https://github.com/odegnome/Vehicle_surveillance) and Reinforcement Learning.

I'm currently working on [Briefs](https://github.com/odegnome/briefs). It is similar to twitter where
people/organisations create posts and these posts are viewed by subscribers. Currently, brief uses
JSON for output but I plan to implement [protobuf](https://blog.postman.com/what-is-protobuf/) for
effecient communication messages.

Checkout out my [dissertation](https://github.com/odegnome/sb3_quad) project where I trained
an autonomous quadrotor to fly in constrained environment.

I'm open to contributing to open source projects. Please reach out and we can collaborate ü§ù.
